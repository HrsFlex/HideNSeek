# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new/empty chat application project. The repository currently contains only an empty `idea` file, indicating this is in the initial planning/setup phase.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, you'll need to:
1. Initialize the project structure based on requirements
2. Set up the appropriate technology stack (likely Node.js/React for a chat app)
3. Configure build tools, package management, and development scripts

## Architecture Notes

The project structure and architecture will need to be established. For a chat application, consider:
- Real-time messaging (WebSocket/Socket.io)
- User authentication and management
- Message persistence
- Client-server communication patterns
- UI framework for the frontend

## Next Steps

When working on this project, first determine:
- Technology stack preferences
- Project requirements and scope
- Development environment setup
- Initial file structure and configuration
